    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "The code inside a function runs when the function is called, not when it is specified or defined. A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. When you define a function, you are essentially creating a blueprint or a template for that code. It is not executed until you explicitly call the function in your program."

    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "A function is a piece of code which enhanced the reusability and modularity of your program. It means that piece of code need not be written again. A function call means invoking or calling that function. Unless a function is called there is no use of that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function call, also known as a function invocation, is the act of executing a function with specific arguments (input values) and, optionally, storing the return value for further use. When a function is called, the program jumps to the function's code and starts executing the instructions defined inside the function body."

    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "The variable y only exists while the function is being executed â€” we call this its lifetime. When the execution of the function terminates (returns), the local variables are destroyed. Codelens helps you visualize this because the local variables disappear after the function returns.\n"

    "ANSWER:-\n",
    "A return is a value that a function returns to the calling script or function when it completes its task. A return value can be any one of the four variable types: handle, integer, object, or string. The type of value your function returns depends largely on the task it performs."

    "\n",
    "ANSWER:-To save a program from crashing when it encounters an error, you can implement error handling mechanisms. Python provides a built-in mechanism for this called try-except blocks. By using try and except, you can catch and handle errors gracefully, allowing the program to continue executing instead of terminating abruptly"
